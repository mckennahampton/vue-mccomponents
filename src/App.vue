DON'T HURT ME ðŸ˜±</h2>\n<p>Where to begin...</p>\n<p>Have you ever had one of those intense, long-winded dreams that give you a sinking-gut feeling? Where there's a certain aura about everything happening that you're not exactly sure about but you know it feels <em>wrong</em>. Sometimes you also get that neck-hair-raising, back-of-your-heels-tingly feeling when you're at the junction of fight or flight and unable to do anything...</p>\n<p>That's a decent way to describe how life was between about ages 14-24. Prior to that age, I grew up in an objectively unconventional and subjectively cult-aligned environment, albeit blissfully unaware of anything other than the fact that I was in the perfect family and everything my family did was hallowed.</p>\n<p>Over the years I've seen things on TV that struck a nerve with me in ways I couldn't explain at the time. For example, the shows about families like the Duggars in \"${children.length} kids and counting\". There's obviously a lot of pseudo-elements in shows like that, so I was never really sure how closely their life mimicked the one they presented on the TV. However, that show always felt strangely familiar in ways I couldn't put my finger on.</p>\n<p>Another example is the movie <em>Big Fish</em>; when I originally watched it, my best friend (who happens to be a cinephile) could not understand why I didn't like the movie, and I couldn't really either. Upon trying to re-watch it recently with my wife - we didn't even made it past the first act before turning it off and realizing why I was not a fan of it before.</p>\n<p>One of the primary themes that movies like&nbsp;<em>Big Fish</em> shows about families like the Duggars have in common is&nbsp;<strong>love.</strong> In particular,&nbsp;<strong>love &amp; family</strong>. While you might be thinking \"Oh wow what an original observation, these human stories talk about love, holy shit\" - I know I am not the next Plato. No, what I'm talking about is a very specific kind of \"family love\" where the \"love\" is all about control, keeping up appearances, and those lower in the family hierarchy submitting to the ones above them.</p>\n<p>In any family, there is going to be times of strife, tension, arguments, etc. - that's what families do. You're all cooped up under the same roof, stepping on each other's toes, annoying each other in those extra-precise ways that make the annoyance go from 1 to 100 immediately. When the family and the love between everyone is healthy, these things have a way of working themselves out - people are honest, they listen to each other, they apologize, and they make amends. Of course, it's usually not that straightforward or that clean - and it certainly doesn't mean you're not going to piss each other off again in 30 minutes - but the point is, in a healthy family dynamic, there is not a giant overhanging family-specific agenda inherent in all things that you must abide by. Rather, you live and operate in love and honesty with each other in a continuous effort to do good, learn, and grow.</p>\n<p>In an&nbsp;<em>unhealthy</em> family like I'm talking about here, there&nbsp;<strong>absolutely&nbsp;</strong>is an overhanding family-specific agenda inherent in ALL things that involve the family. The agenda is a complicated &amp; abstract thing that has many layers and can take many forms, depending on the environment it's exposed in.</p>\n<p>For example, when in the privacy in their own home, my family has a lot of rules that everyone follows. Most of them are unspoken, and some of them are specifically for the men or women, but they're all applicable when the family is in private.</p>\n<p>In contrast, when my family does business with others (and I mean actual commercial business - we'll get to this later), the unique vibe my family gives off is dialed waaaaaay back so as not to put off potential $$$. It's still there, mind you - just hardly noticeable, and certainly not enough to justify any acknowledgement of it's existence in a professional manner. My family continues to operate in the agenda without pause, but it also becomes generally as flexible as is necessary to both avoid exposure and to facilitate the end goal my family is looking for.</p>\n<p>There is also a special version of my family with this agenda, and that's when you're one-on-one with someone above you. In these times, things tend to get weird and intense. You are told things about what you need to do, how you need to think, what you need to agree with or have a problem with, etc., and you're supposed to nod and agree. If you offer any dissent - well, you're wrong, and that's only going to cause the special one-on-one time to last longer than it needs to.</p>\n<p>I cannot tell you how many hours-long lecture I got as a child from my father like this. At first glance, that might sound normal. If you kid is being naughty, you will probably have a talk&nbsp; with them - sounds like good parenting. I think the exception in this case is due both to the content of these talks and the precedent that they set for me growing up.</p>\n<h2>Umm... Me no get an agenda...</h2>\n<p>When I say&nbsp;<em>agenda</em>, let's dive into exactly what I mean by that.</p>\n<p>By&nbsp;<em>agenda</em>, I do not mean the general approach and structure to life that any given family has. Any decent parents will provide their children with a solid, thoughtful framework in which to raise them up in. What I mean by&nbsp;<em>agenda</em> more closely aligns with the third definition of the word according to the Oxford dictionary (as-of this writing in 2023):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>agenda</p>\n<p>the intention behind what somebody says or does, that is often secret</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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...

    {"id":178,"author_id":1,"title":"About Page","slug":"about-page-823a51","excerpt":"About Goodbye Dad","body":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>There are as many ways to parent a child as there are people who've ever lived, and yet we all come across the same pitfalls. I am not the best person to be writing about parenting. My opinions on the topic are heavily biased from lifelong exposure to a very specific, and extremely difficult to articulate, form of parenting.</p>\n<p>I am a&nbsp;<span class=\"age\">insert_age </span>year old man born and raised in the central part of the United States. I was born into a family that, like every other family, had it's issues. After about 21 years of being alive with them, I really started to think my family's issues were&nbsp;<em>abnormal</em>. Seeing as my family owns and operates a manufacturing company with national distribution, and this company is an integral part of my upbringing, the content of this website is anonymized. Certain details such as names &amp; places have been changed to this end, but the rest of the content here is true.</p>\n<p>I will do my best to recount these stories with as much detail and accuracy as possible. Due to the nature of what happened in these writings, there are some things that will be difficult for me either to remember or to express myself clearly about; I will notate when this happens.</p>\n<p>If you have experienced physical, psychological, or emotional trauma in your past, please consider this a content advisory: Some of the primary topics I will be exploring on this website are religion, <span class=\"definition\">narcissism</span>, parenting, and abuses of power. Themes will include religious trauma, controlling tactics, and narcissistic emotional abuse, among others.</p>\n<h2>The Family</h2>\n<p>I'm not sure where to begin about my family. I've thought about this countless times, and I'm always left without a definitive starting point in my mind, so I will just begin somewhere. My family is a close-knit group of self-ascribed hustlers. I am the middle child of three boys; my older brother was from my father's first wife, and I and my little brother are from my father's second wife, who have been together for about 30 years now.</p>\n<p>My parents had by myself and my little brother home-birthed; there is plenty of home video to prove this which I have unfortunately seen. My parents also home-schooled all three of us for all of our education. We had \"home church\" every Sunday as well. To top it all off, the house I was born and raised in was about 0.1 miles away from my family's business, where I was told I'd be working for the rest of my life from at least the time I was old enough to remember.</p>\n<p>My family also owns and operates a nationally-distributed manufacturing company. It was started by both my great-grandfather and my grandfather, and over the years most of my family has worked there to at least some capacity. I worked there until I was 23, and my grandfather, great-uncle, father, and both of my brothers still work there to this day.</p>\n<p>I mention all of this because the Company is an integral part of my family's makeup. After experiencing my family first-hand for so many years, it is in my humble opinion that my family, specifically the men on my father's side, are prone to a specific flavor narcissism that has been perfected over many generations.</p>\n<p>After having met and interacted with my family on a casual basis, I've heard most people describe my family as good and friendly people. Those that know and see my family regularly joke about how they \"wouldn't want to negotiate with them\" and say \"they're intensity is just them being passionate about what they believe\". Family insiders like my grandparents, I heard how my father's parenting \"comes from a place of love\".</p>\n<p>But for myself and my brothers who grew up under the roof of my father, things are much more gray and complicated to unravel.</p>\n<h2>So, why goodbye.dad?</h2>\n<p>The name is provocative on purpose, and I think it effectively captures the heart of my life journey thus far. I'm a full-stack software developer who has been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. Being effective in this role required you to be able to see a project from start to finish in your mind, plan out every step of the process, understand all of the technologies that will be involved, and then build said project. It's not for everyone, and there are definitely days where I imagine a more peaceful life of being a remote researcher deep in Antarctica, but really there isn't another field of work I would want to do.</p>\n<p>I started learning about software development when I was around 18, and over the years I started to apply the principles of software design patters into my everyday life. I started to realized what made a good software developer wasn't have intricately they knew every aspect of a coding language, but rather how well they were able to understand things at a high level.</p>\n<p>One of the most crucial aspects of being a good developer is the ability to break down a problem into smaller chunks. In order to do that, you have to be able to&nbsp;<em>understand</em> the problem. When I'm starting work on a new software bug, I have to make sure I fully understand what the problem I'm trying to solve is. I do that by asking myself these questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How critical is the problem?</li>\n<li>How often is the problem happening?</li>\n<li>Where is the problem happening?</li>\n<li>What evidence do we have of the problem?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I'm not able to answer these questions, then I need to find the answers before I can effectively start working on the solution. However, once I am able to answer them, there are more questions to be answered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When did the problem start?</li>\n<li>How can we avoid this problem in the future?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two questions are the most critical, and often the most difficult, to get an answer to. Before you settle on a solution, you need to make sure you understand exactly what the problem is, so that you can understand exactly&nbsp;<em>how</em> and&nbsp;<em>when</em> it started, so you that you can both develop a solution to fix it now and also&nbsp;<em>change your ways</em> so as to avoid creating the same problem down the road.</p>\n<p>As I continued learning and gaining experience in the software field, these principles aided me in the rest of my everyday life, and the majority of my every day life involved my family to at least some degree. I had a lot of mentally idle time, and I began thinking about some of my frustrations with my family, particularly with my father, from the perspective of a black-box piece of software. This helped me break down my life into things I could better understand and helped me chart a path forward.</p>\n<p>For many years, I felt alone with my problems. I couldn't make sense of them to myself, and I had not seen other families like mine, so as a result, I thought I was uniquely afflicted. Over time, I began to notice other people with similar complaints as I had. I saw the same types of problems coming from other families and even other types of social groups like churches and sports teams. I recognized there were some core shared elements between them all - power, manipulation, &amp; control.</p>\n<p>The biggest question I had, and still have to this day, is&nbsp;<em>why?&nbsp;</em>I could never imagine treating my own son the way I was treated growing up, so what possessed my father, and his father before him, to demand constant submission from his wife and children? Surely there is a reason for this behavior, however backwards, and I as determined to understand it to the best of my ability.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I realized that I needed to completely deconstruct&nbsp;<em>everything</em> about my way of thinking. Most prominent of which was my idea of what my father was to me, and that meant what I thought about fatherhood in general too. I had to say&nbsp;<strong>goodbye</strong> to the idea I had of what my&nbsp;<strong>dad</strong> was in order to understand the root of the problems I was facing and be able to move on.</p>\n<h2>Stay positive</h2>\n<p>I want to challenge what the general idea of fatherhood is, but not to throw it away. On the contrary - I want to embrace fatherhood. I think having a good father and mother are among the most important aspects of the circle of life. It's also not something you ever get the chance to redo; you only have one chance to parent your child, and you <strong>will</strong> make mistakes. So, from a software perspective, when you have&nbsp;<em>one chance</em> to do something, there are some key elements to effectively handle the situation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand that perfection is not possible</li>\n<li>Pay attention to the details and events as you go in order to be able to respond to them</li>\n<li><strong>Do not be married to any one way to do</strong> <strong>things</strong>; instead, critically review your approach and be ready to change it when necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I'd like this website to do is to challenge the idea of fatherhood not to disregard fatherhood itself, but rather to refine what it means, allow for constructive criticism, and hopefully leave with a more effective approach to it.</p>","category_id":8,"published":null,"created_at":"2023-10-17T13:04:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T01:43:27.000000Z","deleted_at":null,"tag_ids":[],"category_name":"Meta","author":{"id":1,"name":"McKenna","profile_photo_url":"https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=M&color=7F9CF5&background=EBF4FF"},"attachments":[],"tags":[],"category":{"id":8,"name":"Meta","slug":"meta-5aafa5","created_at":"2023-09-23T18:59:54.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T18:59:54.000000Z","deleted_at":null,"tag_ids":[],"post_count":0,"tags":[]}},

    {"id":180,"author_id":1,"title":"Life, A Retrospective","slug":"life-a-retrospective-1ada75","excerpt":null,"body":"<h2>What went wrong?</h2>\n<p>Today is November 21st, 2023. The weather has been wonderfully dreary with cloudy skies and cold rain the past week. It's my favorite time of year - but not because of the holidays or festivities. I haven't really enjoyed those for a long time, but I'm working on that. No, it's my favorite time of year because when I was younger, the fall &amp; winter months meant the busy season for my family's company was finally behind me for that year. No more intense heat, no more training new co-workers how to meet unrealistic expectations with the full knowledge they will likely be fired as soon as possible, and no more 10+ hour shifts. The fall and winter months bring a sense of peace. The pace of life feels slower.</p>\n<p>This year the holidays are going to be strange. For myself they will potentially be the best I've had in a long time. For my parents however, this year will probably be difficult. It will be the first time I won't be present for them since I've been alive. Here is the list of holiday festivities that I will be missing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pre-Thanksgiving cookout on Wednesday (my parents house)</li>\n<li>Thanksgiving dinner (My aunt &amp; uncle's)</li>\n<li>Black Friday morning breakfast (My parents &amp; grandfather)</li>\n<li>A Christmas movie almost every night (My parents)</li>\n<li>Various nights throughout December of looking at Christmas lights (my parents)</li>\n<li>Christmas Ornament party (My parents)</li>\n<li>Christmas Eve morning (My maternal grandparents)</li>\n<li>Christmas Day Morning (My parents)</li>\n<li>Christmas Day Evening (My paternal grandparents)</li>\n<li>New Years Eve (My paternal grandparents)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The amount of holiday stuff I have every year has always surprised my friends, who typically have maybe 2-3 a year. The list above is about 30-40% smaller than it was a decade ago too. Some people might see that many holiday events and think \"Wow, so much family time! There must be a whole lotta love there!\". They wouldn't necessarily be wrong, but if they imagined a cozy, Hallmark-movie style set of gatherings, they might be disappointed after joining for one.</p>\n<p>But, the lack of a real-life Hallmark movie every year is not why I will not be joining them this year. So what exactly went wrong? It's difficult to summarize succinctly, but essentially it became undeniable that the life I wanted was in direct opposition to what being involved with my parents, and by extension pretty much the entirety of my extended family, demanded of me.</p>\n<p>I remember thinking that by the time I was my age, I would have things pretty well figured out. But here I am at 28 years old and feeling like I understand less about everything than I ever have. It's something I've noticed as I've gotten older; the more you experience and understand, the more you realize just how much you&nbsp;<em>don't</em> and likely&nbsp;<em>won't ever</em> know.</p>\n<p>Compared to just a decade ago, the list of things I \"believe\" in is a lot smaller. I would die for what remains on that list. Everything else kind of falls into a gray area that I might think plenty about on a given day, but unless I am convinced I should put my energy into it, I tend to put it back in the gray pile.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>how and why</em> my family is the way they are has been in the gray pile for as long as I can remember. However, after over a decade or wrestling with what I ought to to about it, this year's events finally had me land on the fact that I could not allow my parents in my life any longer or else they would influence my nearly 2 year old son, and the thought of that was enough.</p>\n<h2>What do I do with all this extra time?</h2>\n<p>The separation from my parents (and again, by extension the rest of my family) has been progressive. Shortly after I moved out of my parents house and got married (which were 1 month apart), I realized that one of my worst fears was coming true: what I had just endured for 21 years was not over, but rather an entirely new struggle just began, and that was resisting the ever present, overbearing presence of my family's expectations. Of which, in hindsight, are extremely manipulative if not downright cult-like.</p>\n<p>Before I moved out, the amount of things I did with my family was&nbsp;<em>intense</em>. It's one of many, many things that I only realize in hindsight were ridiculous and not normal. Here is a brief, non-exhaustive list<br>Every week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mon-Fri: Eat dinner together every day (nothing wrong with that)</li>\n<li>Sat: Must wake up no later than 8am on Saturday and sit in the living room with everyone else. There must be no TV, phone, book, video game etc. out. There must be no speaking, unless Father engages in speaking first. You must not let Father think you are anything but happy to be there. This is Father's waking up time.</li>\n<li>Sat: Must go Saturday shopping with them; typically this is from about 11am - 4pm and involves going to multiple grocery stores. Not going is not an option.</li>\n<li>Sat: Watch a Saturday night movie together (yay!)</li>\n<li>Sun: Morning home-church</li>\n<li>Sun: Lunch at maternal grandparents (about 11:45am - 2:30pm)</li>\n<li>Sun: Visit great-grandmother (2:45pm - 4:00pm)</li>\n<li>Sun: Visit paternal grandparents (4:00pm - 5:30pm)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every month:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone's birthday is celebrated by the entire family with a party. Some months have many birthdays, and they are lumped into one get-together on a weekend (non-optional)</li>\n<li>Whatever minor holiday (Easter, Memorial Day, 4th of July etc.) was happening was celebrated with the family on a separate, non-birthday-party day (non-optional)</li>\n<li>Additionally, birthdays, along with personalized holidays like Mother's Day and Father's Day, were celebrated with multiple, separate parties with each prospective group. For example, my birthday consisted of:\n<ol>\n<li>A birthday lunch with my Father</li>\n<li>A birthday dinner made by my Mother</li>\n<li>An immediate-family-only birthday party</li>\n<li>An extended-family birthday party</li>\n<li>A friends-allowed + extended-family birthday party</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If somehow a weekend did not have a family gathering on the calendar, then my parents would want their kids to come for dinner usually</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every Year</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanksgiving + Christmas extravaganzas like mentioned above</li>\n<li>Family vacation - each year, my parents would take a 2-week vacation with my maternal grandparents, which me and my siblings always joined</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm sure I will remember more regular events, but that's a good summary of the routine schedule of my family that I was fully a part of until I was 21 and (finally) able to move out. Up to that point, even at 21, if I didn't join then&nbsp;<em>every single weekend</em> to go grocery shopping for 4+ hours and spending&nbsp;<em>every single&nbsp;</em>weekend evening handing out with them, I would be scolded and shamed for doing so. At that point, I was hellbent on being as good of a son as possible and exiting that phase of my life in peace, so I obliged.</p>\n<p>And then, after I moved out and got married, my world changed! All of that went away and I could do what I wanted! No more unending expectation of spending every waking minute with my family!</p>\n<p>Oh, how wrong I was...</p>\n<h2>Forever a child</h2>\n<p>By 21, I was pretty sick of the family vacations. I had been working for my family since as long as I could remember, and I remember working there on my \"winter breaks\" from being home-schooled as young as 8. They have me 2 weeks of vacation a year, and I always had to use them to go on the family vacations. They stopped being fun after I was about 13 I think. But, after moving and out getting married, they still expected me and my new wife to go on vacation with them. And, that first year, we obliged. But shortly after getting back from that , we realized we were completely within our rights to&nbsp;<strong>stop</strong> going to them altogether so we could have our own. It was a wild concept for us all at the time - my older brother had continued going on the family vacations without skipping a beat, and he had already been married for several years. Heck, both him and my little brother still go on the family vacations, and they bring their entire families.</p>\n<p>When I told my parents that beginning the following year, we would not be joining on the family vacations any longer, they thought I was joking. I had to reiterate that I was serious more than once. I was then met with several of the five stages of grief. For months after that, my parents would bring it up all over again.</p>\n<p>\"So you're still not going on vacation with us? What are you even going to do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't believe you're not coming any more. You've always come on vacation!\"</p>\n<p>\"It won't be the same without you\"</p>\n<p>\"Have you changed your mind yet?\"</p>\n<p>You get the idea.</p>\n<p>This continued for&nbsp;<em>literal years</em> after that. I think it took not joining family vacation for the 5th consecutive time for them to settle down and stop bringing it up. Herein lies a recurring theme I've experienced since leaving my parent's house: I want to stop doing something I've always done with them, they are surprised by this and insist it's not a good idea for as long as possible, and eventually they back off. There is usually a sense of tension left behind by this, but things move on.</p>\n<p>This repeated for&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. Me and my wife continued joining my parents in visiting my grandparents &amp; great-grandparents for years. ANY time we didn't join them, it was a whole thing. We had to explain why, so that they could relay this to my grandparents/great-grandparent, and we had to make sure we let them know how disappointed we were to miss it. After years of this, we eventually weaned off of joining altogether, and it was a slow and painful experience.</p>\n<p>N...
